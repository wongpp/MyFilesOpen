## Handwritten Formula Recognition

### Original Formula:
The original formula is given as:

$$  
X_n = \left( rac{X_{n-1}}{Y_{n-1}} \cdot 2^{(6)} + \left( X_{n-1} - rac{X_{n-1}}{Y_{n-1}} 
ight) Y_{n-1} 
ight) + S_{n-1}  
$$

### Simplified Formula:
By simplifying, we get:

$$  
X_n = X_{n-1} \cdot \left( rac{2^{(6)}}{Y_{n-1}} + 1 - \left( rac{1}{Y_{n-1}} 
ight) Y_{n-1} 
ight) + S_{n-1}  
$$

## Further Simplification to Remove $X_{n-1}$

To remove explicit $X_{n-1}$:

$$  
X_n = X_{n-1} \left( rac{2^6 - 1 + Y_{n-1}}{Y_{n-1}} 
ight) + S_{n-1}  
$$

This shows that $X_{n-1}$ cannot be fully eliminated without losing the recursive relationship.

## General Form Expression with Initial Condition $X_0$

If $X_0$ is a constant, we can express $X_n$ in a non-recursive form:

$$  
X_n = X_0 \cdot \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \left( rac{2^6 - 1 + Y_i}{Y_i} 
ight) + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \left( S_j \cdot \prod_{k=j+1}^{n-1} \left( rac{2^6 - 1 + Y_k}{Y_k} 
ight) 
ight)  
$$

## Parallelization of Accumulation and Multiplication

### Strategy for Parallelization

1. **Parallel Product Calculation**: Use parallel reduction to compute the product of terms across multiple threads.
2. **Parallel Sum Calculation**: Compute prefix products and use parallel reduction to sum up terms involving products.

### Example Implementation in Python using CuPy

```python
import cupy as cp

# Example data
n = 10000  # Size of data
X0 = cp.array(1.0)  # Initial constant
Y = cp.random.rand(n) + 1  # Avoid division by zero
S = cp.random.rand(n)

# Step 1: Compute the product using parallel prefix product
prefix_products = cp.cumprod((2**6 - 1 + Y) / Y)

# Step 2: Compute the sum using parallel prefix product
S_terms = S * cp.concatenate(([1], prefix_products[:-1]))  # Multiply S_j by the corresponding prefix product
sum_result = cp.sum(S_terms)  # Parallel reduction sum

# Step 3: Compute the final X_n
X_n = X0 * prefix_products[-1] + sum_result

# Display the result
print(X_n)
```

### Explanation

1. **`cp.cumprod(...)`**: Computes the cumulative product in parallel using GPU acceleration.
   
2. **`cp.concatenate(...)`**: Combines prefix products for multiplication with $S_j$.

3. **`cp.sum(...)`**: Performs a parallel reduction sum on the GPU.

## Summary

This method leverages parallel reduction techniques for both multiplication and accumulation parts, maximizing the utilization of the GPU's capabilities. The use of libraries like CuPy simplifies the parallelization process, as it handles the intricacies of GPU operations efficiently.
