Yes, we can simplify the formula further to eliminate $X_{n-1}$ on the right-hand side by factoring it out. Here's the given simplified formula:

$$
X_n = X_{n-1} \cdot \left( \frac{2^{(6)}}{Y_{n-1}} + 1 - \frac{1}{Y_{n-1}} \right) + S_{n-1}
$$

Step-by-step Simplification

1. Combine Terms Inside the Parentheses:

$$
\frac{2^6}{Y_{n-1}} + 1 - \frac{1}{Y_{n-1}}
$$

2. Combine Like Terms:

$$
\frac{2^6 - 1}{Y_{n-1}} + 1
$$

3. Simplify Further:

Now the equation becomes:

$$
X_n = X_{n-1} \cdot \left( \frac{2^6 - 1}{Y_{n-1}} + 1 \right) + S_{n-1}
$$

Resulting Simplified Formula

Now, letâ€™s rewrite it to remove $X_{n-1}$ explicitly as a separate factor:

$$
X_n = X_{n-1} \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_{n-1}}{Y_{n-1}} \right) + S_{n-1}
$$

This formula is as simplified as it can get while still depending on $X_{n-1}$. However, if you meant removing the explicit multiplication by $X_{n-1}$, it's structurally not possible since $X_n$ is recursively dependent on $X_{n-1}$.

Conclusion

The presence of $X_{n-1}$ in the formula indicates that it is a recursive relationship, meaning each $X_n$ is built upon the previous value. If you want to completely remove $X_{n-1}$, you would need to either provide an initial condition and compute iteratively or reformulate the problem. Let me know if you want to explore a non-recursive formulation or if you need any further adjustments.

Given that the initial condition $X_0$ is a constant, we can express $X_n$ in a non-recursive form by expanding the recursive relation step-by-step.

Recurrence Relation

The recurrence relation we have is:

$$
X_n = X_{n-1} \cdot \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_{n-1}}{Y_{n-1}} \right) + S_{n-1}
$$

Step-by-Step Expansion

To express $X_n$ in terms of $X_0$ (the initial condition), we expand the recurrence:

$$
X_1 = X_0 \cdot \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_0}{Y_0} \right) + S_0
$$

$$
X_2 = X_1 \cdot \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_1}{Y_1} \right) + S_1
$$

Substitute $X_1$:

$$
X_2 = \left( X_0 \cdot \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_0}{Y_0} \right) + S_0 \right) \cdot \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_1}{Y_1} \right) + S_1
$$

General Form Expression

To find the general form for $X_n$, we observe a pattern where each term depends on the product of all previous multiplicative factors and the sum of all previous additive terms:

$$
X_n = X_0 \cdot \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_i}{Y_i} \right) + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \left( S_j \cdot \prod_{k=j+1}^{n-1} \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_k}{Y_k} \right) \right)
$$

Final Expression

The expression above provides a non-recursive form for $X_n$:

1. Product Term: Represents the compounded multiplicative effect starting from $X_0$.
1. 
2. Sum Term: Accounts for the additive effects of $S_j$ at each step, scaled by the subsequent multiplicative terms.

To parallelize the accumulation (sum) and multiplication (product) parts in the formula for GPU computation, we can use parallel reduction techniques. These techniques are commonly used in GPU programming to compute sums and products efficiently by splitting the tasks across multiple threads.

Formula Recap

The general form of the expression for $X_n$ is:

$$
X_n = X_0 \cdot \prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_i}{Y_i} \right) + \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \left( S_j \cdot \prod_{k=j+1}^{n-1} \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_k}{Y_k} \right) \right)
$$

There are two main parts to parallelize:

1. Product Part (Multiplication Reduction):

$$
\prod_{i=0}^{n-1} \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_i}{Y_i} \right)
$$

2. Sum Part (Accumulation Reduction):

$$
\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \left( S_j \cdot \prod_{k=j+1}^{n-1} \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_k}{Y_k} \right) \right)
$$

Parallelization Strategy

To parallelize these operations on the GPU, we can use the following strategies:

1. Parallel Product Calculation

The product calculation involves computing the product of a series of terms. This can be parallelized using a parallel reduction technique:

- Step 1: Split the product computation into chunks that can be handled by multiple GPU threads. Each thread will compute the partial product of its assigned chunk.
- Step 2: Combine the partial results using a tree-based reduction, where pairs of partial products are multiplied together until a single product remains.

This approach is highly efficient on GPUs, as they are designed for massive parallelism.

2. Parallel Sum Calculation with Nested Product

The sum part requires computing a sum where each term involves another product. Here's how we can parallelize this:

- Step 1: Use a parallel prefix product computation for the terms $\prod_{k=j+1}^{n-1} \left( \frac{2^6 - 1 + Y_k}{Y_k} \right)$. This allows for computing all prefix products efficiently.
- Step 2: Compute the sum in parallel by assigning each GPU thread a different $j$. Each thread will:
  - Retrieve the precomputed prefix product for its respective range.
  - Multiply the prefix product by $S_j$ to form the term for the sum.
  
- Step 3: Use a parallel reduction to sum up all these terms, similar to the method used for the product.

```python
import cupy as cp

# Example data
n = 10000  # Size of data
X0 = cp.array(1.0)  # Initial constant
Y = cp.random.rand(n) + 1  # Avoid division by zero
S = cp.random.rand(n)

# Step 1: Compute the product using parallel prefix product
prefix_products = cp.cumprod((2**6 - 1 + Y) / Y)

# Step 2: Compute the sum using parallel prefix product
S_terms = S * cp.concatenate(([1], prefix_products[:-1]))  # Multiply S_j by the corresponding prefix product
sum_result = cp.sum(S_terms)  # Parallel reduction sum

# Step 3: Compute the final X_n
X_n = X0 * prefix_products[-1] + sum_result

# Display the result
print(X_n)
```
